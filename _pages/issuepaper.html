<h1>In Pursuit of the Archival Commons: Designing Finding Aids for Participatory Archives</h1>
<i>
  An “archival commons” involves user participation in the archive’s construction of meaning and knowledge. As an archive’s main entry point, finding aids should embody this ethos. I will argue for archivists to build a more participatory finding aid framework by drawing from Web 2.0 functionalities and scholarship regarding archival transparency.

  <h2 id="sec1">Introduction</h2>
  The usability and affordances of online finding aids has been the subject of much debate since their introduction in the late 1990s. This paper is about rethinking the finding aid within the framework of current discourse surrounding the creation of the “archival commons” – a vision of the archive that seeks to realize a more user-centric and peer-based approach to description and access, most commonly through participatory Web 2.0 technologies such as user-generated content and folksonomies. As has been argued by numerous scholars such as Lisa Coats, Dennis Meisner, Elizabeth Yakel, and Joy Palmer over the past decade, current methods of archival processing remain more committed to dealing with the perceived needs of the collection than those of their users. Some of the reasons for this involve existential ruminations regarding the role of the archivist and the nature of archival authority, while others deal with the formidable conundrum of adapting to new technological and cultural shifts in an increasingly digital world. I will argue that the online finding aid should serve as a platform for the making of the “archival commons”, engaging the public in the eternally iterative operation of archival processing and knowledge management. As most of my work experience has been within academic archives and creating finding aids for the OAC, the examples that I draw from and the proposals that I make will likely be most relevant to finding aids created in such settings. I will consider questions of how findings aids are produced and maintained, and what is to be gained by making them participatory sites for the production and preservation of memory and meaning. I will draw upon Elizabeth Yakel’s Polar Bear Expedition project as a launch point for discussion into utilizing Web 2.0 functionalities for enabling user participation in archival knowledge making. I will reflect on the implications such changes will hold for the profession as a whole, and propose some next steps forward.

  <h2 id="sec2">Beyond “finding”: Finding aids as mediated sites of knowledge</h2>
  The term “finding aid” is a rather insular one, being used commonly only within the archival profession. As stated by the website of the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), finding aids are “tools that help a user find information in a specific record group, collection, or series of archival materials”.<a href="#foot1"><sup>1</sup></a> The Society of American Archivists (SAA) defines a finding aid in two ways. The first one echoes the sentiments of NARA almost verbatim: “a tool that facilitates discovery of information within a collection of records”.<a href="#foot2"><sup>2</sup></a> The second definition is a bit more elaborate, defining finding aids as “a description of records that gives the repository physical and intellectual control over the materials and that assists users to gain access to and understand the materials”.2 Both sources then provide a few definitions-by-examples, stating that finding aids could be in a variety of formats including card catalogs, calendars, guides, inventories, and registers.3,4 However, I find that such definitions obscure the fundamentally epistemological problems that underlie the task of archival processing. While it is certainly true that the finding aid’s primary function is to provide access points to the materials it describes, it is also necessary to acknowledge its implicit involvement in the act of knowledge making and of representation. 
</p>

<p>
As discussed by sociologist Erving Goffman, objects and artifacts change meaning and are re-contextualized over time.1 This is especially the case for archival collections, which serve as the means for forming conceptualizations and re-conceptualizations of the past, present, and future. In the process of their creation, finding aids give rise to a certain archival narrative through the ways in which they describe and structure representations of materials in a physical or digital collection. They are themselves mediated documents, created within a certain temporal, cultural, technological, and institutional context that shapes the ways in which they are interpreted and used. Since archival materials are oftentimes unique, ephemeral, and possess contextual value beyond their immediate content or appearance, the task of describing them is a complicated, murky issue filled with anxieties about what gets left out or is misrepresented. It is essential to account for these factors in order to create a finding aid that does not present itself as an objective list of item descriptions and locations. Beyond being a tool for researchers to know what items are where, the finding aid should be a platform where these “archival anxieties” can be brought to light and scrutinized, one that is reflective of the changes in values, meaning, and knowledge production of the individuals and communities that use them.

  <h2 id="sec2">Current conditions: The static online finding aid</h2>
  The creation of the online finding aid was enabled by the development of encoding standards such as Encoded Archival Description (EAD), which was developed in the mid-1990s to provide a XML-based standard for making online finding aids searchable and indexable by machines.1 Since its development, EAD has become the defacto standard for encoding online finding aids. However, EAD has since been treated almost as an end in itself, with many scholars wondering whether EAD was truly in sync with the information retrieval behavior patterns of their users.2 Overall, there has been little study into the usability of current finding aids, and the metrics by which to quantify this have yet to be established. In tandem with the development of the EAD was also the creation of one of the largest existing union databases for archival finding aids: the Online Archive of California (OAC). However, a brief look at almost any finding aid on the OAC shows that the affordances of finding aids have not really progressed beyond those of their paper-based days. Finding aids on the OAC exist as a long block of text that forces users to find materials using one of either two ways: the browser keyword search function Ctrl+F or by scrolling through the hierarchical ordering of series and subseries that was established by the archivist throughout the course of processing. Oftentimes, there are no clickable hyperlinks that serve to connect a collection to others of its kind, and no way to allow for user feedback. In some respects, digital finding aids provide even less affordances for their users than do their paper counterparts. In a 2007 study, University of Michigan’s School of Information professor Elizabeth Yakel writes that many scholars preferred paper finding aids over electronic ones because they showed physical signs of use – such as dog-eared pages and annotations – that helped to inform researcher’s information retrieval process.3 In other words, the finding aid became more valuable with evidence of user participation.

  <h2 id="sec3">Experiments in participatory finding aids</h2>
  The rise of the internet and the era of decentralized authority has led to a number of experiments into the formation of participatory sites of knowledge and the “archival commons”. In discussing the notion of the “archival commons”, I will borrow a definition provided by Scott R. Anderson and Robert B. Allen, who described it as “a space where cultural professionals, researchers, and interested members of the general public could contribute narrative and links among objects of interest held by archives, libraries, and/or museums and systematically reflect those activities within the primary repository itself”.1 Since finding aids serve as the main entry points to a collection, they are fundamentally crucial to realizing such a “commons”. One of the most commonly referenced examples of a finding aid that has successfully embedded participatory engagement into its very design has been the Polar Bear Expedition Digital Collection. Spearheaded by Elizabeth Yakel and the Finding Aids Next Generation (FANG) research group, the project experimented with new approaches for engaging communities in a participatory archive. The collection refers to an assemblage of sub-collections composed of journals, correspondence, photographs, and other materials that document the experience of US soldiers who were sent to fight the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. The site was launched in 2006 and featured various means for promoting “social navigation”.

  In her 2007 performance report for the site, Yakel describes the four primary tools that her research team built into the Polar Bear website to facilitate user engagement: commenting, collaborative filtering, bookmarking, and visitor awareness.1 Participants in the experiment were allowed to create user accounts where they could contribute to metadata about a given item, as well as asynchronously communicate with an archivist “at any point” – presumably within the standard working day hours. They would also be able to view the contributions of other users and know who was currently active on the site. Their site also provided users with a series of recommended links that “sought to provide alternate and unexpected interrelations between subjects and collections that will enable researchers to make unanticipated connections between records”.2 The ability for users to participate in making changes to the archive occurred without overturning the central authority of “The Archivist” (the pseudonym under which the Bentley Historical Society’s group of archivists collectively presented their online presence).3 However, the success this archive has garnered as an experiment in collaborative memory and knowledge building was largely dependent on the fact that it had a size-able, engaged user group and the fact that a significant portion of its collections had already been digitized. Furthermore, since 2011, the project appears to have lost maintenance and now only remnants of it are accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. As with most digital projects in general, sustainability remains a perennial issue. One important observation to note in my research into participatory online finding aids is that, much like the Polar Bear Expedition Project, all deal with digital collections. However, it is important to emphasize that digitization need not set the basis for establishing a participatory finding aid framework. Participatory finding aids should not be conflated with the notion of digital archives. Rather, they should speak to the ways in which issues of finding aid description and access are mediated between the archivists and their research community.

  <h2 id="sec4">Creating participatory finding aid platforms for the “archival commons”</h2>
  <u>Suggestion 1: Identify the needs of the commons and decentralizing curation</u><br>
  One of the first and most challenging steps towards creating finding aids for the realization of the “archival commons” would be to identify and bring together the researchers who utilize the finding aids and to access their needs. This would require communication between the archivist and their various user communities regarding the types of research they are conducting and the types of materials they would be interested in studying. Archivists should seek to understand the uses to which finding aids are employed and identify areas where their users are encountering difficulties or left wondering about the ambiguities of an item’s description or arrangement within the finding aid. They should also seek to understand what types of materials users are interested in to make determinations about whether an item should be digitized for greater access. This can be done through focus groups if a collection is particularly popular and has a large user group. For collections that do not receive as much attention, information on researchers’ experience of a finding aid can be collected at the individual level, such as through voluntary entry and exit surveys that users can fill out so that they can share their expectations upon coming into an online finding aid, and upon leaving, specify whether or not their expectations had been met or changed in interacting with the finding aid.  
</p>

<p>
  <u>Suggestion 2: Allow users to contribute information through comment fields and tagging</u><br>
  Finding aids do not have to be transformed into digital archives Finding aids such as the ones on the OAC currently lack any features for finding aid users to respond to the how materials are described or arranged within a collection. One approach may be to attach to every entry in a finding aid an expandable comments field where individuals can impart their specialized knowledge regarding the materials in question, or to allow the appending of a keyword tag. Initiatives such as the Hypothes.is Project are already seeking to “annotate all knowledge” by providing an open-source software that will allow for an annotation layer to overlay the online site of publishing companies and digital libraries such as JSTOR, arXiv, and Wiley, allowing scholars to annotate documents and contribute to a growing body of knowledge.1 Furthermore, in the spirit of the commons, where there is no centralized authority dictating how information can be used, the comments need not be concerned with the materials directly. For example, if a researcher knows that one archive contains the correspondence of Person A to Person B and another archive contains the correspondence of Person B to Person A, they should be encouraged to provide links establishing the connection between the two resources. To allow such knowledge to disappear after it has served the needs of a single researcher, as things are structured currently where individuals utilize the archive in silo, would be a waste of the intellectual labor and other resources put in to making that discovery and lead to redundant work. Helping to foster signs of use and engagement with the materials will have a positive feedback effect and compel other individuals to share their views as well.

  <h2 id="sec5">Implications of a participatory archive on the role of an archivist</h2>
  While numerous archival institutions are aware that many of their collections are in need of reprocessing or that their finding aids are severely outdated, the task of updating pales in comparison to dealing with the deluge of materials that have yet to be processed at all. As such, the finding aid is quite often presented – willingly or not – as a “final version” when in reality it should reflect the iterative nature of archival processing. It is important that archivists develop the mindset for producing, as Kate Theimer puts it, “iterative products, not ‘perfect’ products”.1 Recently, the Center for Primary Research and Training at UCLA’s Young Research Library has been piloting a graduate student position for a “Redescription Scholar” tasked with “identifying finding aid descriptions that contain outdated, culturally insensitive or oppressive language in order to redescribe collections that better reflect self-description by communities”.2 It would be absurd to pretend that the meaning relayed by archival finding aids were representative of an absolute truth; as such, the capacity to demonstrate that archivists are not, in-fact, “all knowing” is a crucial aspect that needs to be designed into a finding aid. Such “fallibility” could be demonstrated by documenting changes made to finding aids through version control, allowing user to see the ways in which a finding aid has developed over time. Changes resulting from user input could also be denoted in a different color in order to preserve the original description. In doing so, the finding aid becomes a dialogic platform, a document of use and interpretation that records shifts in discourse regarding the materials over time.
</p>

<p>
  In the years ahead, the profession will have to face the influx of increasingly large and more heterogeneous collections, both in terms of their historical contexts and the types of media or materials they comprise. Already, many archival institutions are reporting that their backlogs take up close to a third of their entire collection holdings.1 In their proposal for a “more product and less process” framework, Green and Meissner argue that archivists should focus on minimizing the time they spend on description and instead focus on providing just enough descriptive context to allow researchers to work with material.2 This will require revising existing workflows and forms of practice, including a more reciprocal relationship between archival professionals and their users. Furthermore, in order for a finding aid to truly embody the spirit of participatory engagement and the “archival commons”, it is important that archivists themselves strive to be transparent about their role as active agents in the processing of an archival collection. UNLV archivist Michelle Light and Harvard librarian Tom Hyry have suggested the addition of a colophon that would come at the end of the finding aid and would “record what they [the processing archivists] know about the history and provenance of a collection and to reveal appraisal, arrangement, description, preservation, and other decisions they made while working on a collection”.3

  <h2 id="sec6">Conclusion</h2>
  A call for a more participatory finding aid that embodies the ethos of the “archival commons” means providing ways for users to contribute to and shape the way knowledge is represented in the archive. It also means re-evaluating the role of the archivist as gatekeepers in the preservation of memory and knowledge. It will raise questions about the nature of archival authority, and will run counter to the opinions of those who believe in the sanctity of the archival record. However, a more participatory framework can help open archives to new users and ensure that the past contributions of researchers or other users can be integrated within the archival narrative. Naturally, it would be important to mention the issues that will arise within the framework of a participatory archive, such as the inevitable need for content moderation. However, the design and affordances of finding aids should reflect the notion that knowledge is created through a collaborative process, and that it is a “living document” reflective of the changes in meaning and significance that it acquires through the course of its use.
