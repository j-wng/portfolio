   My entry into this field was an accidental one, inspired in part by an opportunity to work with special collections materials during an undergraduate history capstone seminar and a deep interest in historiography. After spending my senior year working as an undergraduate processing assistant in the Center for Primary Research and Training at YRL, I applied to this program declaring a specialization in archives. Going into the program, I had the good fortune to secure a technical services student work position at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, where I was able to work closely with the archivist and catalogers to organize, describe, and appraise materials according to best practices. Having had some experience working in the hodgepodge space that characterizes special collections, and having the guidance of individuals who were more than willing to teach me skills that I had no prior coursework experience in, such as cataloging, I decided that I could afford to branch out in terms of my academic coursework and take courses outside the field of archives to develop a more interdisciplinary perspective.

   Over the course of this program, I have selected classes primarily in informatics, an act which I will not deny was due in some significant part to the four years I spent prior to this program as an undergraduate majoring in microbiology and molecular genetics. Taking Public Health Informatics was one such decision, as was deciding to join a team involved with the information architecture redesign of an environmental DNA sample collection research team in my user experience class. I am always trying to incorporate elements of my previous educational upbringing into my work, but the shift in career track has not always been a comfortable one. As anyone who looks at my curriculum vitae would be able to surmise, I have often had trouble pinning down a specific area of interest. Even now, after having recently taken a course on the Marxist theory of history, I feel the stirrings of a desire to pursue further studies in history and critical theory. However, my time in this program has also taught me the sheer impossibility of describing anything in its totality. I am fascinated by the ways in which the sciences, social sciences, and the humanities overlap, and I feel that the LIS profession remains the best place to explore and to get others to engage in these liminal spaces.

   Over the past year, I have steadily developed an interest in the field of digital humanities and digital libraries. I had taken a few computer science courses as an undergraduate and the idea of working with data and programming has always appealed to me. In my time working at the UCLA Digital Library, I have learned how to work with different markdown languages, automating tasks using bash scripts, working with Github, and digital asset management, all the while taking numerous workshops on a variety of technologies such as geospatial mapping and Jupyter Notebook. My methodologies class on Digital Research and Scholarship exposed me to even more tools, including natural language processing (NLP), topic modeling, and website development and hosting. When I took Professor Posnerâ€™s class in the following quarter, I was able to further solidify my skill sets in data visualization and web development. In the immediate future, I plan to continue to develop greater proficiency in languages such as python and javascript. I feel that the introduction of these tools to humanities and social science research poses a transformative development in the field, and that over time these tools will become more accessible to a larger audience. As such, I also hope to be able to acquire some pedagogical skills in this regard, perhaps by getting involved with Library Carpentry.

   My immediate goals upon graduation are to apply for positions in digital libraries. As someone who would never had entered the profession if I had not already had an interest in history, I am interested in utilizing digital libraries as a way to draw in students from the math and sciences field, increasing the visibility of the work being done in the information science field and promoting more interdisciplinary research. I would also like to build upon my work with user experience and to be involved in projects that seek to re-envision the way digital libraries and archives engage with their users and include them in the process of knowledge making.

   In my time as a graduate student, I have made the oversight of not being proactive with joining professional organizations in my field. However, I am now actively working on developing projects/case studies that I could present at the Association for Computers and Humanities (ACH) Conference and at the Digital Library Federation Forum. My advisor Miriam Posner has also suggested that I apply for funding to attend the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI). The DHSI, which takes place in June of every year, provides numerous week and week-end long courses that teach valuable practical skills in data curation, linked data, and managing digital content as well as courses in critical pedagogy and research ethics, and would certainly provide a nice way to ease out of the academic rigor graduate school before easing into the professional arena.
