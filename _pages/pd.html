   My entry into this field was an accidental one, inspired in part by an opportunity to work with special collections materials during an undergraduate history capstone seminar and a deep interest in historiography. After spending my senior year working as an undergraduate processing assistant in the Center for Primary Research and Training at YRL, I applied to this program declaring a specialization in archives. Going into the program, I had the good fortune to secure a technical services student work position at the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, where I was able to work closely with the archivist and catalogers to organize, describe, and appraise materials according to best practices. Having had some experience working in the hodgepodge space that characterizes special collections, and having the guidance of individuals who were more than willing to teach me skills that I had no prior coursework experience in, such as cataloging, I decided that I could afford to branch out in terms of my academic coursework and take courses outside the field of archives to develop a more interdisciplinary perspective.
