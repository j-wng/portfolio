  <h2 id="sec1">Introduction</h2>
  As genetic sequencing technologies become increasingly efficient and affordable, the proliferation and use of DNA records and the implications of maintaining DNA databases or repositories become an increasingly pressing matter. Despite being comprised of the same components – records that must be managed, arranged, and preserved – that characterize an archive. DNA databases do not tend to be the subject of attention within the archival discipline. They do not fall under traditional notions of  “the archive” as a physical or digital space where items of historical and contemporary importance, evidence, or narratives are stored and interpreted. However, trying to argue that DNA records are stored in a “database” and not an “archive” – evoking the perennial debate on the semantics between “repository”, “databank”, “archive”, and “database” – and that archival studies has no application to this field would be a significant oversight. Doing so obscures the archival concepts and issues attending the use and creation of DNA databases, such as those of memory, evidence, and transparency. This paper will first contextualize DNA databases within a historical context of scientific recordkeeping, then proceed to frame the DNA record as both a material and digital document. The paper will go on to discuss some of the controversies surrounding the establishment of modern-day DNA databases, putting them in the context of archival theory and ethics particularly with regards to issues of record’s privacy, confidentiality, accessibility, and acquisition.

  <h2 id="sec2">DNA Records: Origins in the recordkeeping of a “universal” classification</h2>
The discovery of DNA in the mid-20th century as the molecule responsible for generating almost all life (with the exception of RNA-based organisms) on Earth has fundamentally redefined scientific efforts towards classifying and understanding life forms. Prior to the development of tools to detect and quantify genetic differences, biology taxonomies were largely based on gross morphological and behavioral features such as an organism’s number of limbs or their reproductive patterns. To draw from a classical Western example, Aristotle was one of the earliest thinkers to come up with a classification system for animals. His classification was based on such aspects as “those with and without blood” and viviparity versus oviparity.1 Classification is deeply rooted in the act of recordkeeping and the construction of collections and archival “microcosms” for making more generalized conjectures about natural phenomenon at large. Early modern European cabinets of curiosities were developed largely in part out of efforts to classify, describe, and thus make intelligible findings from Western European explorations and colonial expansions into the New World. Carefully curated and arranged, cabinets of curiosities served as a means of representing the boundaries of the known and unknown world.2 Given the impossibility of grasping a totality of the world, the creation of a discrete collection, archive, or repository becomes the prerequisite for the production of any form of knowledge.

However, it is also important to note that there is a reciprocal relationship between classification and the creation of archives. While collections often serve as the source materials for creating taxonomies and certain knowledge schemas, the process of aggregating materials for an archive is always already based in certain preconceptions about the social and natural world. For example, one of the fathers of physiognomy Giambattista della Porta, wrote a treatise in the 1570s relating the morphology of a person’s hands to their temperament after visiting a prison in Naples, Italy.3 His observations and documentations of hand morphology and other bodily features were already embedded in the social and legal norms of what constituted criminality in the 16rh century. As is being increasingly argued within the field of contemporary archival theory, no archive was ever created from a void to preserve a neutral narrative of the world. Such Jenkinsonian notions of the archive as the product of an objective reality completely disregard the various value systems, ideological constructs, and circumstances that defined their creation. As the basis for all multi-cellular life on Earth, the DNA sequence has acquired a certain level of empiricist, universalistic credo, overturning many paradigms within the field of biological taxonomy. At the same time, it is also important to treat DNA records with the same level of caution that should be accorded when interpreting all human artifacts. They are subject to re-interpretation, leading to unforeseen implications and generating unforeseen consequences. As new forms of material and digital (ultimately still material) records, DNA records and the databases or repositories in which they are stored invoke the very same issues of memory, accountability, evidence, identity, and responsibility that form the fundamental concerns of the archival practice.

  <h2 id="sec3">DNA as a material record</h2>
The materiality of DNA is concealed in its microscopic size. The structure of DNA can only be rendered vaguely visible to the human eye under complex, stabilizing chemical conditions and the use of incredibly high-powered electron microscopes. For the majority of those who have taken any preliminary biology course, DNA takes the shape of a colorful, linear double helix connected by “rungs”. It can be replicated by protein complexes when the cell is ready to divide, and unravel at certain positions to change protein expression in order to modulate cellular functions. While the physical structure of DNA has been validated through extensive and diverse methods of experimentation and modeling, the visualization that has become  an abstraction no matter how chemically precise or structurally accurate the depiction. Even when represented using advanced 3-D modeling software that depict the physical proportions, dimensions, and interactions of the molecule, the physicality of DNA and its orchestration of biological processes does not lend itself to easy documentation. However, as a material record alone, DNA has very little use. For DNA to be studied and understood as the document of an individual, it almost always has to be interpreted in a way that resolves its genetic sequence (with the exception of certain biochemical research or medical studies where the structure of DNA might be more important than its sequence). DNA sequencing, starting from its early manifestation in the Sanger method developed in the 1980s to the high-throughput processes of today, is the primary tool used in the generation of the DNA sequence record. In this process, DNA is converted from a material phenomena into a “rational”, understandable sequence, stored in a .fasta or .2bit file type to be processed by bioinformatic programs. By determining the linear sequence of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine nucleotides that comprise a single gene or genome and performing large-scale comparisons with other samples, it becomes possible to identify certain “genetic markers” that could have identifying, categorical, comparative, or predictive purposes.

An individual’s genetic sequence is a biochemical record that can be analyzed within certain parameters to describe certain aspects of its subject, whether it be the person’s medical condition, ethnic background, or criminal status (in the case of forensics). Thus, DNA falls comfortably into the framework of a “document” as described by Suzanne Briet: “evidence in support of a fact”.1 It should be qualified that the “fact” being referenced here is not absolute, but a belief widely held to be true within a given circumstance. As will be discussed later in the paper, the genetic record is subject to varying interpretations and use. Immutable (as far as the sequence is concerned) and difficult to conceal given the human body’s penchant for shedding off dead cells, DNA is a ubiquitous and unique document that can paint a very intimate and perhaps novel portrait of the individual in question that reflects greater sociopolitical beliefs and concerns.

<h2 id="sec4">A myriad of DNA records and databases</h2>
Despite the materiality of DNA and the experimentally determinable nature of their nucleotide sequence, the generation of a DNA record is not free of bias. The terms “DNA record” or “DNA sequence” are very vague and do not reflect the variety of genetic documents that get deposited for different purposes by collecting institutions. Today, DNA databases are used in a variety of fields. They aid research in precision medicine, crime scene investigations, and genealogy mapping. As such, the types of genetic information stored in these databases can range from an individual’s copy of a single genetic marker to, in rare cases, their entire genome sequence. Law enforcement agencies and forensic labs tend to emphasize the documentation of short tandem repeats (STRs), areas in the genome containing a highly variant (polymorphic) number of short nucleotide string repeats that are believed to meet the threshold of effectiveness for distinguishing between individuals. The genetic profiles of convicted individuals stored in the massive United State Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) are generated from an analysis of 20 select STR locis known as the CODIS Core.1 On the other hand, popular consumer genetics company 23andMe utilizes a different analytical procedure that genotypes individuals using markers known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) – variations in a single nucleotide at a particular location across a genomic population.2 In a 2016 blog post, 23andMe responded to concerns about law enforcement inquiries into the company’s database, stating that “23andMe’s test focuses on how you are like other people, while forensic tests focus on how you are different from other people”.3  The differences in the type of DNA record being created, they argue, is generally significant enough to render 23andMe’s records incomparable with those in CODIS, thereby making them of little use to law enforcement. 23andMe further states that even if law enforcement were compelled to inquire into their records, the DNA records that the company creates do not satisfy the “chain of custody” requirements needed to establish a record as “evidence” since the services are offered online.4

DNA records are also rarely ever just a list of an individual’s genetic sequence. They are oftentimes accompanied with various other types of data, such as those regarding an individual’s socioeconomic status, ethnicity, lifestyle habits, and even political viewpoints.1 Ultimately, it is important to recognize that a genetic record is generally not a literal read-out of an individual’s genetic sequence, but the approximations of certain biochemical and statistical manipulations under the direction of fallible algorithms that satisfy (or give the illusion of satisfying) an institutional and consumer need.
