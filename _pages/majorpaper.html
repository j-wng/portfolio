<h1>The Archival Concerns of DNA Databases</h1>
<i>Written for Professor Anne Gilliland's IS431: Archives, Records, and Memory in Fall 2017</i> <br>
This paper was written for Professor Gilliland’s introductory archives course in response to an open-ended prompt to consider the recordkeeping principles and archival concerns of a digital database. I decided to draw from my undergraduate studies in microbiology and molecular genetics by applying an archival lens onto DNA databases. The term “archive” is rarely used within the scientific community, so I thought it would be interesting to interpret the rise of DNA databases and the sociopolitical issues they’ve garnered through the framework of archival principles, and to understand their placement in the greater history of records management. The majority of the paper was written in Fall 2017 and has been edited and extended since. The original paper can be found <a href="/portfolio/assets/MajorPaper_OriginalV_JW.pdf">here</a>.

  <h2 id="sec1">Introduction</h2>
  As genetic sequencing technologies become increasingly efficient and affordable, the proliferation and use of DNA records and the implications of maintaining DNA databases or repositories become an increasingly pressing matter. Despite being comprised of the same components – records that must be managed, arranged, and preserved – that characterize an archive. DNA databases do not tend to be the subject of attention within the archival discipline. They do not fall under traditional notions of  “the archive” as a physical or digital space where items of historical and contemporary importance, evidence, or narratives are stored and interpreted. However, trying to argue that DNA records are stored in a “database” and not an “archive” – evoking the perennial debate on the semantics between “repository”, “databank”, “archive”, and “database” – and that archival studies has no application to this field would be a significant oversight. Doing so obscures the archival concepts and issues attending the use and creation of DNA databases, such as those of memory, evidence, and transparency. This paper will first contextualize DNA databases within a historical context of scientific recordkeeping, then proceed to frame the DNA record as both a material and digital document. The paper will go on to discuss some of the controversies surrounding the establishment of modern-day DNA databases, putting them in the context of archival theory and ethics particularly with regards to issues of record’s privacy, confidentiality, accessibility, and acquisition.

  <h2 id="sec2">DNA Records: Origins in the recordkeeping of a “universal” classification</h2>
The discovery of DNA in the mid-20th century as the molecule responsible for generating almost all life (with the exception of RNA-based organisms) on Earth has fundamentally redefined scientific efforts towards classifying and understanding life forms. Prior to the development of tools for detecting genetic variations, biology taxonomies were largely based on morphological and behavioral features such as an organism’s number of limbs or their reproductive patterns. To draw from a classical Western example, Aristotle was one of the earliest thinkers to come up with a classification system for animals. His classification was based on such aspects as “those with and without blood” and viviparity versus oviparity.<sup>1</sup>  Classification is deeply rooted in the act of recordkeeping and the construction of collections and archival “microcosms” for making more generalized conjectures about natural phenomenon at large. Early modern European cabinets of curiosities were developed largely in part out of efforts to classify, describe, and thus make intelligible findings from Western European explorations and colonial expansions into the New World. Carefully curated and arranged, cabinets of curiosities served as a means of representing the boundaries of the known and unknown world.<sup>2</sup>  Given the impossibility of grasping a totality of the world, the creation of a discrete collection, archive, or repository becomes the prerequisite for the production of any form of knowledge.
</p>	

<p>  
However, it is also important to note that there is a reciprocal relationship between classification and the creation of archives. While collections often serve as the source materials for creating taxonomies and certain knowledge schemas, the process of aggregating materials for an archive is always already based in certain preconceptions about the social and natural world. For example, one of the fathers of physiognomy Giambattista della Porta, wrote a treatise in the 1570s relating the morphology of a person’s hands to their temperament after visiting a prison in Naples, Italy.<sup>3</sup>  His observations and documentations of hand morphology and other bodily features were already embedded in the social and legal norms of what constituted criminality in the 16rh century. As is being increasingly argued within the field of contemporary archival theory, no archive was ever created from a void to preserve a neutral narrative of the world. Such Jenkinsonian notions of the archive as the product of an objective reality completely disregard the various value systems, ideological constructs, and circumstances that defined their creation. As the basis for all multi-cellular life on Earth, the DNA sequence has acquired a certain level of empiricist, universalistic credo, overturning many paradigms within the field of biological taxonomy. At the same time, it is also important to treat DNA records with the same level of caution that should be accorded when interpreting all human artifacts. They are subject to re-interpretation, leading to unforeseen implications and generating unforeseen consequences. As new forms of material and digital (ultimately still material) records, DNA records and the databases or repositories in which they are stored invoke the very same issues of memory, accountability, evidence, identity, and responsibility that form the fundamental concerns of the archival practice.

  <h2 id="sec3">DNA as a material record</h2>
The materiality of DNA is concealed in its microscopic size. The structure of DNA can only be rendered vaguely visible to the human eye under complex, stabilizing chemical conditions and the use of incredibly high-powered electron microscopes. For the majority of those who have taken any preliminary biology course, DNA takes the shape of a colorful, linear double helix connected by “rungs”. It can be replicated by protein complexes when the cell is ready to divide, and unravel at certain positions to change protein expression in order to modulate cellular functions. While the physical structure of DNA has been validated through extensive and diverse methods of experimentation and modeling, the visualization that has become  an abstraction no matter how chemically precise or structurally accurate the depiction. Even when represented using advanced 3-D modeling software that depict the physical proportions, dimensions, and interactions of the molecule, the physicality of DNA and its orchestration of biological processes does not lend itself to easy documentation. However, as a material record alone, DNA has very little use. For DNA to be studied and understood as the document of an individual, it almost always has to be interpreted in a way that resolves its genetic sequence (with the exception of certain biochemical research or medical studies where the structure of DNA might be more important than its sequence). DNA sequencing, starting from its early manifestation in the Sanger method developed in the 1980s to the high-throughput processes of today, is the primary tool used in the generation of the DNA sequence record. In this process, DNA is converted from a material phenomena into a “rational”, understandable sequence, stored in a .fasta or .2bit file type to be processed by bioinformatic programs. By determining the linear sequence of adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine nucleotides that comprise a single gene or genome and performing large-scale comparisons with other samples, it becomes possible to identify certain “genetic markers” that could have identifying, categorical, comparative, or predictive purposes.
</p>

<p>
An individual’s genetic sequence is a biochemical record that can be analyzed within certain parameters to describe certain aspects of its subject, whether it be the person’s medical condition, ethnic background, or criminal status (in the case of forensics). Thus, DNA falls comfortably into the framework of a “document” as described by Suzanne Briet: “evidence in support of a fact”.<sup>4</sup>  It should be qualified that the “fact” being referenced here is not absolute, but a belief widely held to be true within a given circumstance. As will be discussed later in the paper, the genetic record is subject to varying interpretations and use. Immutable (as far as the sequence is concerned) and difficult to conceal given the human body’s penchant for shedding off dead cells, DNA is a ubiquitous and unique document that can paint a very intimate and perhaps novel portrait of the individual in question that reflects greater sociopolitical beliefs and concerns. 
</p>

<p>
<h2 id="sec4">A myriad of DNA records and databases</h2>
Despite the materiality of DNA and the experimentally determinable nature of their nucleotide sequence, the generation of a DNA record is not free of bias. The terms “DNA record” or “DNA sequence” are very vague and do not reflect the variety of genetic documents that get deposited for different purposes by collecting institutions. Today, DNA databases are used in a variety of fields. They aid research in precision medicine, crime scene investigations, and genealogy mapping. As such, the types of genetic information stored in these databases can range from an individual’s copy of a single genetic marker to, in rare cases, their entire genome sequence. Law enforcement agencies and forensic labs tend to emphasize the documentation of short tandem repeats (STRs), areas in the genome containing a highly variant (polymorphic) number of short nucleotide string repeats that are believed to meet the threshold of effectiveness for distinguishing between individuals. The genetic profiles of convicted individuals stored in the massive United State Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) are generated from an analysis of 20 select STR locis known as the CODIS Core.<sup>5</sup>  On the other hand, popular consumer genetics company 23andMe utilizes a different analytical procedure that genotypes individuals using markers known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) – variations in a single nucleotide at a particular location across a genomic population.<sup>6</sup>  In a 2016 blog post, 23andMe responded to concerns about law enforcement inquiries into the company’s database, stating that “23andMe’s test focuses on how you are like other people, while forensic tests focus on how you are different from other people”.<sup>7</sup>   The differences in the type of DNA record being created, they argue, is generally significant enough to render 23andMe’s records incomparable with those in CODIS, thereby making them of little use to law enforcement. 23andMe further states that even if law enforcement were compelled to inquire into their records, the DNA records that the company creates do not satisfy the “chain of custody” requirements needed to establish a record as “evidence” since the services are offered online.<sup>8</sup> 
</p>

<p>
DNA records are also rarely ever just a list of an individual’s genetic sequence. They are oftentimes accompanied with various other types of data, such as those regarding an individual’s socioeconomic status, ethnicity, lifestyle habits, and even political viewpoints.<sup>9</sup>  Ultimately, it is important to recognize that a genetic record is generally not a literal read-out of an individual’s genetic sequence, but the approximations of certain biochemical and statistical manipulations under the direction of fallible algorithms that satisfy (or give the illusion of satisfying) an institutional and consumer need. 
</p>

<p>
<h2 id="sec5">Early DNA archives and efforts towards “empiricist” studies of difference</h2>
Though national DNA databases started to emerge in countries such as the UK, Brazil, and United States in the late 1990s – largely for forensic purposes – the widespread acquisition of genetic material from specific groups of people was embedded in a popular ideology of post-1960s biological research that DNA could empirically elucidate human evolutionary history. This fixation on the DNA sequence as a neutral document illustrated a high level of naivete on the part of the scientific community at large when it came to understanding the sociological and political impacts of the findings they made. Population geneticists and anthropologists alike were convinced that DNA analysis could produce an “objective” and “anti-racist” science free of the blatant prejudice that had defined eugenics and social Darwinism. They believed that the quantifiable materiality of DNA could somehow produce a non-ideological understanding of differences between groups of people. With such notions in mind, a group of population geneticists at Stanford University launched the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) in the early 1990s.<sup>10</sup>  Led by prominent geneticist Luca Cavalli-Sforza, the team sought to conduct an expansive survey of the diversity of the human genome by collecting DNA samples from more than 50 indigenous populations around the world.<sup>11</sup>  While these samples were originally acquired with the promise that they would be used to help the medical needs of these communities, it became clear not long after that these documents were becoming a new site for colonialism.
</p>

<p>
In 1993, the HGDP was widely denounced by numerous indigenous communities and human rights organizations for patenting genetic materials without the awareness of the indigenous participants, as well as, according to anthropologist Jonathan Marks, for “creating artificial genetic distinctions” between groups.<sup>12</sup>  Historian of science Cathy Gere termed the HGDP’s collection of DNA and other biological materials as constituting a “biocolonial archive”, a holding of plundered bio-records obtained through an imperialistic legacy.<sup>13</sup>  The records contained in the database are neutral in the sense that they were obtained via a standardized experimental protocol for acquisition of a DNA sample. However, they came into existence within an institutional framework that failed to uphold values of transparency and confidentiality, and instead, treated people’s DNA data as assets to be sold at the researchers discretion. Again, such studies were being conducted in the midst of theoretical trends in evolutionary biology which “rested on the conviction that indigenous genomes partook of a unique genetic purity” free of “the mongrelizing and displacing effects of cosmopolitan modernity”.<sup>14</sup>  In light of such views, the HGDP’s collection of indigenous DNA samples recapitulated the actions of extractive, early 20th century anthropological methods, which were spurred by the urgency of needing to preserve the traces of a “vanishing” people. In separating the record and the human from which it was derived, the HGDP’s “biocolonial archive” presents a classical case of the bureaucratic, extractive archive that failed to prioritize social good, particularly within historically marginalized populations.
</p>

<p>
 <h2 id="sec6">Surveillance and consent in the collection of DNA records</h2>
The methods by which DNA samples are acquired for a repository remain one of the most controversial aspects in the establishment of DNA databases. According to the Dutch archivist-scholar Eric Ketelaar, the agency of the individual from whom the documents were obtained should be one of the determinants of a documents’ value and accessibility for posterity.<sup>15</sup>  Records obtained under coercive circumstances and/or in the absence of informed consent should have restrictions in their use and access, or be eliminated all together. Unfortunately, that an archive may contain information about a person without their knowledge or consent is nothing particularly new. The covert collection of information has throughout history laid the foundations for maintaining state control, some of the most blatant examples being the Stasi files of East Germany and the FBI’s counter-intelligence program (COINTELPRO), which had actively spied on and sought to discredit and disrupt civil rights, Black Power, feminist and other “politically subversive” activist groups during the 1960s. As mentioned in the previous section concerning the origins of the HGDP and its implementation as a biocolonial archive, issues of consent are inextricably tied to not only the collection of DNA but also to the context of their use.
</p>

<p>
The issues revolving around the collection of genetic information becomes particularly controversial in forensic and disciplinary settings. The United States Combined DNA Indexing System (CODIS) is a software platform that analyzes DNA records kept in forensic laboratories at the national (NDIS), state (SDIS), and local level (LDIS). All together, they make up the world’s largest DNA database. As of April 2019, CODIS contains the STR profiles of more than 17 million individuals, 13 million of which originate from offenders.<sup>16</sup>  The incorporation of DNA records into these three levels, each with their own standards of use and access, occurs in a hierarchical fashion. In most cases, samples are deposited first in the local level of the CODIS database. If the individual is convicted or arrested, the sample is then transferred into the state or national repositories. State repositories are regulated on a state-by-state basis, but many local and regional labs, while also officially subject to federal and state laws, operate with much greater autonomy. A 2013 New York Times article (notably published only a week after the Snowden NSA surveillance leaks) reported a rising number of DNA samples that were acquired covertly by law enforcement agencies across the country. Many records are obtained from low-level offenders in exchange for plea bargains, with the justification that data from the NDIS corresponded primarily to convicted criminals who were already going to prison. The Times article also reports on surreptitious feats of DNA collection, with investigators obtaining and retaining for unspecified amounts of time samples from discarded waste, crime scenes, and the victims themselves.<sup>17</sup>  The blanket collection and storage of DNA without a clear retentions period makes it impossible for individuals to take control of their own genetic data. In another example, the Electronic Frontiers Foundation reports efforts to collect DNA from refugees and asylum seekers as well as their families.<sup>18</sup>  The preemptive collection of DNA in such conditions can be seen as a breach of 4th amendment rights, with the mere implication of the person in the database being to some degree a document of guilt.
</p>

<p>
Even outside the realm of law enforcement, there are numerous occasions in which DNA records could be covertly produced and collected. Many hospitals in the United States are now rapidly amassing blood samples from newborn babies as a result of the many health screenings that babies now all undergo. It is estimated that up to 98% of newborn babies now undergo such genetic screening, and while such residual blood samples were tossed out in previous years, many have since ended up being stored in a national newborn DNA bank.<sup>19</sup>  In most cases, parents are unaware of the DNA depositing that occurs after the screening, and efforts to obtain consent are often misleading. For example, many states have an “opt-out” option for screening tests altogether, rather than for the storage of samples in newborn DNA banks.<sup>20</sup>  Defendants of the newborn DNA database argue that the samples will be used for the purposes of medical research, although what that precisely entails is largely unknown. Regardless of how the data is used, the generation of the genetic record must be dealt with greater transparency.
</p>

<p>
Even if genetic material is provided voluntarily, there are currently very little regulations for how such information could be re-used. Over the past decade, a growing public interest in recreational genealogical studies has led to the creation of massive pools of individual’s DNA sequences. Recently, FamilyTreeDNA, the fourth largest commercial DNA testing company in the world, admitted to sharing its user’s DNA data with the FBI for forensic purposes despite extensive marketing claiming itself as a staunch protector of consumer privacy.<sup>21</sup>  Informed consent becomes meaningless if conditions for records reuse change after an agreement is duly made, or made apparent to the individuals affected only after a breach of privacy. Rather than terminating their data sharing practices with the FBI, FamilyTreeDNA has instead modified their terms and conditions agreement to provide users the ability to opt-out of having their DNA associated with those of suspected criminals. With information being transmitted with ever-increasing ease, and collected at more and more checkpoints within one’s daily life, it seems that the distinction between public and private information has become increasingly liminal.
</p>

<p>
The issue of unregulated DNA record formation and collection can be viewed as a matter of appraisal and reappraisal. As noted by scholar Anne Gilliland, one aspect in the proper appraisal of a document for archival keeping involves “assessing the kinds and degrees of bureaucratic, legal, research, cultural, community, personal and intrinsic values that are present in extant records in order to arrive at a decision about their eventual disposition.”<sup>22</sup>  There are numerous stakeholders involved in genetic records: the contributors of the genetic sample, the database that owns it, and the users of that data who wish to employ it for some (often unforeseen) future purpose. In the case of forensic DNA databases, the legal and personal valuations of the DNA record may conflict, meaning the individual’s desire to keep their DNA record private should be weighed along with the law enforcement’s desire to expand their database of potential criminals. In appraising records obtained from newborn screenings, a similar recognition of the need for obtaining proper consent – as well as providing a way for people to retract their consent if they so desire – should play an integral role in the retention of the document. Furthermore, especially in the case of the forensic database, there should be a standard of appraisal and reappraisal that could better define the retention periods of the DNA documents. In the absence of explicit and enforced retention periods for DNA records, such records are vulnerable to use in contexts that are outside the initial reasons for collection. The act of including a genetic profile into a database requires a recognition of the circumstances in which the documents were produced or acquired.
</p>

<h2 id="sec7">
  Unequal access to DNA data
</h2>
Related to the issue of largely unregulated DNA collection and the lack of informed consent is the disparities in access to such records. The applications of DNA research, whether it be for medical or forensic purposes, are most relevant when there is a large sample of records to draw from. This has led to the commodification of genetic data and the rise of exorbitantly profitable markets for DNA data brokerage. Archives function on the principles of accessibility, which is dependent on people knowing what types of documents they carry, who is represented in their collection, how they are represented, as well as having processes in place that allow for such representations to be contested. This becomes a particularly difficult issue for DNA databases, particularly those collected from crime sccenes, since individuals would not even be aware that their data has been registered. Even in the case of voluntarily donated samples, the donor is not tend to have a clear idea of what aspects of their data are actually being kept by the repository and the contexts in which it can be used. Medical DNA databases also contain one caveat that restricts their access compared to traditional archives: the record has usually been “anonymized”. Ironically, while this is done to safeguard the identity of the donor, numerous studies have emerged wherein researchers were able to re-identify the owner of the sample using the associated metadata.<sup>23</sup>  As mentioned earlier in the paper, there are different types of DNA records. Such records are also often accompanied by other non-genetic metadata regarding an individual’s race, economic status, and medical history. Hence, it is possible that the record remains accessible to other third parties while remaining inaccessible to the individual from whom the sample was taken. This makes it difficult for some individuals to request the removal of their data. This imbalance in the technical aspect of accessibility, as well as the oftentimes sheer lack of knowledge of a record’s existence, makes DNA databases intrinsically prone to breaches in confidentiality on the part of the database itself as well as to external attacks.
</p>

<p>
  <h2 id="sec8">Conclusion</h2>
  DNA records are a relatively new form of identifying document that should be handled with the same considerations as would be applied to traditional archives. They are material records that take on a variety of digital manifestations, and while there are currently a number of policies that try to govern their use, most of these are geared towards DNA collected for biomedical research purposes. With regards to issues of appraisal, accessibility, and privacy, they present numerous challenges that will invoke the same concerns as do archival ethics.
