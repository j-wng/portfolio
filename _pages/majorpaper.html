<h1>The Archival Concerns of DNA Databases</h1>

<p>
  <h2 id="sec1">Introductions</h2>
  As genetic sequencing technologies become increasingly efficient and affordable, the proliferation and use of DNA records and the implications of maintaining DNA databases or repositories become an increasingly pressing matter. Despite being comprised of the same components – records that must be managed, arranged, and preserved – that characterize an archive. DNA databases do not tend to be the subject of attention within the archival discipline. They do not fall under traditional notions of  “the archive” as a physical or digital space where items of historical and contemporary importance, evidence, or narratives are stored and interpreted. However, trying to argue that DNA records are stored in a “database” and not an “archive” – evoking the perennial debate on the semantics between “repository”, “databank”, “archive”, and “database” – and that archival studies has no application to this field would be a significant oversight. Doing so obscures the archival concepts and issues attending the use and creation of DNA databases, such as those of memory, evidence, and transparency. This paper will first contextualize DNA databases within a historical context of scientific recordkeeping, then proceed to frame the DNA record as both a material and digital document. The paper will go on to discuss some of the controversies surrounding the establishment of modern-day DNA databases, putting them in the context of archival theory and ethics particularly with regards to issues of record’s privacy, confidentiality, accessibility, and acquisition.

  <h2 id="sec2">DNA Records: Origins in the recordkeeping of a “universal” classification</h2>
The discovery of DNA in the mid-20th century as the molecule responsible for generating almost all life (with the exception of RNA-based organisms) on Earth has fundamentally redefined scientific efforts towards classifying and understanding life forms. Prior to the development of tools to detect and quantify genetic differences, biology taxonomies were largely based on gross morphological and behavioral features such as an organism’s number of limbs or their reproductive patterns. To draw from a classical Western example, Aristotle was one of the earliest thinkers to come up with a classification system for animals. His classification was based on such aspects as “those with and without blood” and viviparity versus oviparity.1 Classification is deeply rooted in the act of recordkeeping and the construction of collections and archival “microcosms” for making more generalized conjectures about natural phenomenon at large. Early modern European cabinets of curiosities were developed largely in part out of efforts to classify, describe, and thus make intelligible findings from Western European explorations and colonial expansions into the New World. Carefully curated and arranged, cabinets of curiosities served as a means of representing the boundaries of the known and unknown world.2 Given the impossibility of grasping a totality of the world, the creation of a discrete collection, archive, or repository becomes the prerequisite for the production of any form of knowledge.

However, it is also important to note that there is a reciprocal relationship between classification and the creation of archives. While collections often serve as the source materials for creating taxonomies and certain knowledge schemas, the process of aggregating materials for an archive is always already based in certain preconceptions about the social and natural world. For example, one of the fathers of physiognomy Giambattista della Porta, wrote a treatise in the 1570s relating the morphology of a person’s hands to their temperament after visiting a prison in Naples, Italy.3 His observations and documentations of hand morphology and other bodily features were already embedded in the social and legal norms of what constituted criminality in the 16rh century. As is being increasingly argued within the field of contemporary archival theory, no archive was ever created from a void to preserve a neutral narrative of the world. Such Jenkinsonian notions of the archive as the product of an objective reality completely disregard the various value systems, ideological constructs, and circumstances that defined their creation. As the basis for all multi-cellular life on Earth, the DNA sequence has acquired a certain level of empiricist, universalistic credo, overturning many paradigms within the field of biological taxonomy. At the same time, it is also important to treat DNA records with the same level of caution that should be accorded when interpreting all human artifacts. They are subject to re-interpretation, leading to unforeseen implications and generating unforeseen consequences. As new forms of material and digital (ultimately still material) records, DNA records and the databases or repositories in which they are stored invoke the very same issues of memory, accountability, evidence, identity, and responsibility that form the fundamental concerns of the archival practice.
