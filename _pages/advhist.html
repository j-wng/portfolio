   I have many people to thank for my professional and academic development throughout my time in this program. In my first year, I had quarterly meetings with my advisor Professor Christine Borgman, who helped me map out my coursework and encouraged me to explore the different subfields within the information science discipline. She provided me with helpful suggestions for ways to integrate my background in microbiology, immunology, and molecular genetics with the program curriculum.

  Throughout my first year in the program, I was also incredibly fortunate to have had the chance to work with Professor Johanna Drucker on an inventorying project at the community poetry center Beyond Baroque. Along with teaching me the best practices for handling, appraising, and describing materials, she also taught me by example to approach such tasks with a great deal of humor and persistence. It was always a great confidence boost to see the way valued my suggestions and thoughts on the work at hand.

   When Professor Borgman retired following my first year, Professor Miriam Posner generously accepted my request to become one of her advisees, I have had numerous meetings with her over the past few quarters regarding career choices, building my portfolio, balancing academics with work, and how to deal with my own sense of imposter syndrome within the LIS profession after coming from an undergraduate background in molecular biology. She has responded to my indecisiveness and anxieties over the past year with infinite patience and understanding, and has always provided me concrete steps to move forward in whether it be for class assignments or for professional development.

I must also thank everyone at the William Andrews Clark Library. Being geographically distant from the main campus, as well as being overseen by the Center for 17th and 18th Century Studies as opposed to the UCLA Library, there is a unique sense of community there. I have learned various technical and professional skills - from cataloging in Voyager and automating tasks with macros to navigating office politics - from the librarians and staff members there including Rebecca Fenning Marschall, Alejandro Sanchez Nu√±ez, Nina Schneider, Philip Palmer, David Eng, Scott Jacobs, and Anna Chen. I have drawn upon their expertise numerous times for my academic work and am thankful for their indulging me in the process. Through their digitization projects, early modern cookery workshops, and budding seed exchange program, the Clark has taught me what it means to run a community-oriented special collections library.

  I thank Dawn Childress and Geno Sanchez at the UCLA Digital Library, to whom I owe much of my knowledge of the hard skills for data management and digital humanities projects such as data cleaning, metadata standards, and using markup languages. Dawn has also helped me workshop resumes and job applications, and always approved of her student workers spending some of their work time attending job talks and workshops. She has also introduced me to many of her colleagues within the field and helped me expand my network. Geno has imparted upon me some of his considerable user experience expertise to help me with some of my own user experience side projects.

  I have also had the great experience of doing volunteer work for Yolanda Bustos at the Natural History Museum. From her, I have learned some of the best practices for digital asset management and received advice for job hunting and professional development.

  Finally, I would like to take some time to thank some of the individuals who have been responsible for my being in the program in the first place and who I have continued to seek out advice from. This includes Jillian Cuellar (Tulane U) and Courtney Dean (UCLA), who welcomed me into YRL Special Collections as an undergraduate student assistant at the Center for Primary Research and Training. Throughout the program, they have encouraged me to apply to scholarships and provided numerous letters of recommendation. I thank Professor Katsuya Hirano (History, UCLA) for showing me the potential of historiographical inquiry for producing social change, and the central roles that archives play in the endeavor.
