<h1><b><i>Core Paper:</i></b> The Infrastructures of Cryptocurrencies</h1>
<i>Written for Professor Miriam Posner's IS270: Systems & Infrastructures in Winter 2018</i> <br>


<p>
At the time when I was taking Systems and Infrastructure, the world of cryptocurrency trading had been in the midst of its first major crash since the creation of Bitcoin in the beginning of 2009. The event has since been historicized (on Wikipedia, at least) as the “Bitcoin Crash”, or more dramatically, the “Great Crypto Crash”. As the value of cryptocurrencies continued to freefall throughout the months of January and February, the topic stirred significant commotion within the pages of the popular press. Having had a lingering interest in the history of money thanks in large part to a Marxist historian I had as a professor in my undergraduate years, I became interested in studying the technical and social infrastructure that underpinned cryptocurrencies. For the final assignment, the class was asked to do a video project and a supplementary write-up. My video focuses on Bitcoin ATMs as material manifestations of the infrastructure involved in this oft-abstracted form of monetary exchange. The paper takes a more historical perspective and studies the ideological, social, and technological changes that have enabled cryptocurrencies to take root.

<h2 id="p1">Introduction</h2>
Even within today’s highly polarized news environment, it is hard to find a topic more subject to conflicting viewpoints than that of cryptocurrencies. Proponents of the technology claim that it will usher in a new era of commerce, whereas its critics argue that the technology is inherently flawed and destined to collapse spectacularly. This paper on the infrastructure of this so-called “currency” was born out of a curiosity in the history of money – the oft-termed “root of all evil” – and at the time of writing, heavy publicity regarding the crash of poster cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the new measures being taken by different countries to regulate its activity. While money itself is not inherently a sin, however much people may revile financial institutions, the disproportionate distribution of wealth is one of the most glaring, universal indicators of systemic inequality within the world. While cryptocurrency did not emerge out of a desire to eradicate economic inequality, their emergence was rooted in a desire to topple those institutions that are so instrumental to the persistence of unequal conditions. This paper will explore the political and socioeconomic ideologies that underlie cryptocurrencies, the labor and industrial infrastructure of what is commonly accepted as a nebulous monetary system, and the implications that they hold for future economic systems.

<h2 id="p2">Money as Infrastructure and the Infrastructure of Money</h2>
When discussing cryptocurrencies, it may be helpful to look into the historical contexts of money in general and the infrastructural relationships that make it a viable means of exchange. Money – and all the underlying institutions and modes of control that allow it to flow throughout society – provides the transactional power for the perpetuation of economic, social, and political order. While there have been communal societies and movements throughout history that have sustained themselves without utilizing some form of currency for exchange, there are few examples of money-less societies in the present day. Whether it be metal coins, sacks of grains, cattle, or credit, money provides the standards for exchange between the various entities (i.e. workers, institutions, government bodies, to list a few) that make up society. As argued by Marx, money is the material manifestation of the fetishization of social relationships of material production.1 This is evidenced through fiat monies, which possess no intrinsic value other than being issued by state authorities as the official way of trade among its subjects.

By defamiliarizing the idea of money, its everyday use can almost be stated as a “madness shared by many”, where society at large tacitly agrees that these symbolic assets have value both in the present and in the future. Developing an alternative system of exchange would necessarily pit an individual or community against these very imposing standards and their extensive spheres of influence. Propped up by banks, the US Treasury, and other financial institutions, the dollar (and its digital representation via a credit card or a debit card) is a very prosaic item that embodies many of the defining traits of infrastructure, such as ubiquity, centralization, and territoriality.1 While essentially forming the basis of a money-based economy, money is also dependent on a variety of legal, social, and financial infrastructures that enable their continued use.
</p>

<p>
<h2 id="p3">Infrastructural changes with digital forms of payment</h2>
<a href="#foot1">[1]</a>The rise of new social networking and information communication technologies such as near-field communication has heralded new methods of mediating monetary transactions. Examples of this trend include the rent-payment-revolutionizing, peer-to-peer payment app Venmo, the digital wallet Apple Pay, and the international money transfer app Xoom, which is backed by Paypal. Suffice to say, many countries are now moving towards a cashless society. While the gradual decline in paper money can be safely described as a global trend, the manner of transition is by no means a homogeneous occurrence. Numerous Scandinavian and eastern European countries like Sweden and Estonia, as well as China, have made substantial gains in this regard.1 Comparatively, the US is behind in the widespread use of such technologies, and the process of updating its material infrastructure to accommodate such changes is often fraught with challenges. One immediate example is the nationwide roll-out of EMV (Europay, Mastercard, and Visa)-compliant terminals and credit cards in 2015 to better protect against credit card fraud. This transition came a full decade after such technologies had been implemented by other countries, and was met with numerous technical setbacks and changes in legal policies concerning retailers’ liabilities.2 The infrastructure of money is intricately interwoven with various others systems, cultures, and modes of production, although, like other infrastructure, this becomes most apparent upon its breakdown.
</p>

<p>
In all of the cases discussed previously, the basic premise of how money is regulated, distributed, and produced is largely the same – through centralized financial institutions. In undermining such norms, cryptocurrencies have often been touted as serious threats to the nature of current financial systems. On a political level, they threaten the decades-long hegemony of the US dollar. The particularly radical core of cryptocurrencies is their utilization of a decentralized verification system known as blockchain technology. Explanations of the blockchain tend to get rather hairy for the uninitiated and the initiated alike, but they can be generally understood as a transparent, publicly accessible ledger maintained and managed through the consensus of a mass, distributed network of anonymous individuals. In ideal situations, blockchains are irreversible. Every new transaction is added as a “block” onto a “chain” of past transactions, and the exact identities of the parties involved in a transaction are concealed behind an encrypted address. It allows for peer-to-peer exchange without third party oversight. The blockchain cuts out money’s usual flows through financial institutions, speeding up transactions and cutting out processing fees. Bitcoin was the first proof-of-concept for blockchain technology.

<h2 id="p4">Trials in Realizing Crypto-Utopias</h2>
The ideological underpinnings of cryptocurrencies can be traced back to 1980s social movements that advocated the use of cryptographic and privacy-enhancing means to secure individual freedoms from government and corporate control. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, an individual operating under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakomoto released a seminal white paper detailing the implementation of blockchain technology for a new digital currency, later termed the “bitcoin”. In his article, Nakamoto cites a work by computer engineer Wei Dai, who references a late 1980s FAQ document by activist Timothy May titled “The Cyphernomicon”. May’s document contained a stirring section subtitled “The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto”, written for the “cypherpunks of the world”.1 May’s manifesto formed the ideological backbone of the cypherpunk movement, heralding the arrival of a new age of digital egalitarianism rooted in anonymity and privacy. Cypherpunks sought to leverage the development and greater availability of cryptographic technologies to upend the entire apparatus of a centralized state, preventing oppressive institutions from stifling the opinions and wills of the masses. May boldly proclaimed a future where governments “will have a hard-time collecting taxes, regulating the behavior of individuals and corporations (small ones at least), and generally coercing folks when it can't even tell [sic] what _continent_ folks are on”2 For many in the cypherpunk movement, cryptography would help make possible the creation of an autonomous network.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, it should be noted that this surge of crypto-infused optimism stemmed from technology developed largely by the National Security Agency.1 SHA-256 is one of most important secure hash algorithms underlying the Bitcoin network – including numerous other cryptocurrencies – and had been produced by the NSA in the early 2000s. In fact, numerous conspiracy theories abound around the exact origins of Bitcoin, with some believing it to be an elaborate psychological operation on the part of the NSA to roll out a “one-world currency”. A recent report by The Intercept has revealed that the NSA had been actively tracking the activities of Bitcoin owners, seeking to uncover users’ internet addresses, network ports, and timestamps to identify their targets.2 Absolute anonymity also engenders its own slew of problems, providing the means for illegal activity. One of Bitcoin’s earliest meetings with fame came after the arrest of notorious Silk Road drug trafficker Ross William Ulbricht (aka Dread Pirate Roberts), who was discovered to have possessed about $28.5 millions worth in Bitcoins at the time of his arrest.3 Even today, the general perception of cryptocurrencies is that they facilitate illegal activity, rather than provide any challenge to legitimately oppressive financial structures. Many cryptocurrency advocates associate themselves with a controversial term known as “anarcho-capitalism”, a derivative of capitalism free from government regulation. Combined with the libertarian values of absolute privacy and individualism, values shared by a significant proportion of the cryptocurrency community, this definition of anarcho-capitalism ends up echoing the core tenets of neoliberalism, which stresses the superiority of the free market in resolving all financial and social ailment.

<h2 id="p5">Coin Communities</h2>
Given that cryptocurrencies do not have any state backing, their transactional power and viability is dependent on the formation of a community willing to utilize them as units of exchange. In other words, cryptocurrencies require dedicated investors, making them not too different from Silicon Valley tech start-ups. Much of the publicity regarding cryptocurrencies centers around the first crypto Bitcoin, but in the decade since its inception there have been hundreds of altcoins (Bitcoins spin-offs) that have boomed and busted, each appealed (and, oftentimes, scammed) a certain niche group of users. Coins such as Monero (which has an overwhelmingly negative public image stemming from its predominant usage in dark web and black market purchases) were made with privacy as its core principle of design. Others have very specific scenarios of use, such as Potcoin, a cryptocurrency used exclusively for transactions concerning legalized marijuana.1 Dogecoin, which started out purely as a “joke” coin, has been surprisingly resilient to obsolescence despite reports of it becoming a fad as members of the community move onto the next “meme-coin”.2 Most cryptocurrencies are not started with extensibility in mind, lending them an ephemeral quality. With regards to the many legitimate cryptocurrencies that have fallen to the wayside, the issue seems not to be that of a subconscious prizing for “innovation” over “maintenance” as Russell and Vinsel identified in other infrastructures, but to shifts in community interests and the coins’ limited use scenarios.3 For a system that was designed to enable “electronic transactions without relying on trust” – as sought by Satoshi Nakamoto white paper – there is a considerable amount of trust and community-developing involved.

<h2 id="p6">The labor and materiality of cryptocurrencies</h2>
The labor that sustains a cryptocurrency’s operations varies between coin to coin. At the basic level, all cryptocurrencies have the same hardware needs, namely high-performance graphic cards and ASICs (application specific integrated chips), cooling systems, a constant source of cheap energy, and secure networks over which transactions are made. The role of cryptocurrency “miners”, then, is to utilize high-capacity CPUs, GPUs, and special mining chips to solve the complex math problems needed to verify these transactions. A cursory tracking of the supply chain that belies the production of these devices and resources, draws up industries that have become increasingly strained by the exponential growth in cryptocurrency mining activity. While mining was once a process that could be done by an individual working on their laptop, rising energy costs and increasingly difficult cryptographic problems have led to the development of large scale miner farms. In such farms, individuals can purchase servers on remote mining farms, cutting down costs in electricity and maintenance to maximize profit. The mining process brings to light the sheer material foundation needed to keep the cryptocurrency system running. Every step of the infrastructure depends on having a strong, reliable Internet connection as well as sophisticated computer hardware/software capable of performing high-throughput processing of cryptographic algorithms.
</p>

<p>
Cryptocurrency mining incurs heavy environmental costs. According to one 2017 report, the collective energy consumption of mining ventures worldwide exceeds that of over 159 countries, a phenomenon that has received much attention in the press. A 2018 Engadget article reported that China is now seeking to curtail the activities of “cryptocurrency mining enterprises” by increasing electricity rates and introducing stricter environmental regulations. China remains heavily dependent on coal for meeting most of its energy needs, and as the world’s leader in large scale cryptocurrency mining, this gives the terminology of “mining” perhaps an unintended extra layer of meaning. Within the US, cryptocurrency mines have been cropping up in rural areas such as Wenatchee, Washington, often taking root in abandoned warehouses located close to cheap power sources. As expected, the diversion of resources to these ventures has led to significant tension between the mining industry and local communities.

<p>
<h2 id="p7">Conclusion</h2>
Cryptocurrencies rely on complex technological and social infrastructures that have very strong material and environmental impacts. In seeking an alternative to the centralized control of money, they run contrary to various financial and political institutions. As with most technology ill-understood, cryptocurrencies simultaneously carry the power to dismantle and prop up the status quo. The technology has received support from significant figures in the conversation regarding privacy and state control, such as Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, whose organization subsisted substantially off of Bitcoin donations during its inception during the 2011 Wikileaks Banking Blockade. Assange even dubs it as “the real Occupy Wall Street”.1 At the same time, the coveted blockchain technology that is so central to cryptocurrencies has also drawn the interest of former chairman of the US Federal Reserve during the 2008 fiscal crisis Ben Bernanke, who gave a keynote presentation for a cryptocurrency conference in late 2017. Such a figure would have been viewed as “Public Enemy #1” for cryptocurrency traditionalists, and it is unlikely he would have received such a platform during the concept’s earlier years. Capitalism is said to have the capacity to subsume and appropriate other modes of exchange and value. Currently, cryptocurrencies exist in an uncomfortable liminal space between the ideals of 1980s cryptography enthusiasts and the existing structures and institutions of state power.

<h1 id="p8"><b><i>Elective Paper:</i></b> Digital Asset Management Report for Clark Library</h1>
<p>
    I decided to take Digital Assets Management in Spring 2018 with Professor LInda Tadic out of a curiosity in the UCLA Clark Library’s various digital projects. Our assignment was to work with an institution that was in need of or interested in adopting a new digital asset management system and to identify the functional requirements needed of a DAM to best serve the library’s purposes. Since I worked at the Clark Library and was already somewhat familiar to the types of assets they had and their need for a centralized DAM, I decided to use the Clark as my site of study.
